# Pythagorean Triples Finder: A Genetic Algorithm Approach

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a Genetic Algorithm to identify Pythagorean triples effectively. The Genetic Algorithm's success rate is evaluated and compared with that of a random generator to verify the algorithm’s efficacy and efficiency in finding Pythagorean triples.

## Objectives
- **Develop a Genetic Algorithm:** To identify Pythagorean triples efficiently.
- **Evaluate the Confidence Interval:** Using the Wilson Score Interval to ensure the reliability of the program.
- **Compare Success Rates:** Utilizing the Fisher’s Exact Test to compare the Genetic Algorithm with a random generator method.

## Methodology & Tools

### Library
- **DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python):** Utilized for structuring and implementing the Genetic Algorithm.

### Statistical Analysis
- **Wilson Score Interval:** Employed for Confidence Interval estimation using `statsmodels.stats.proportion`.
- **Fisher’s Exact Test:** Used for success rate comparison using `scipy.stats`.

### Programming Language & Platform
- **Python:** The project is implemented in Python, utilizing the extensive libraries and tools available in the language.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Provides an interactive and dynamic coding, testing, and presentation environment.
